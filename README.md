# Stanford CS342 W2025

This is a new repository currently containing the implementation of the CS342 HW1.
This contains simple data objects. Requirements are defined as unit tests.

Note: I believe source code and test code should be the documentation, unless comments are absolutely needed for context of decisions or assumptions.

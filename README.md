# Stanford CS342 W2025
## HW1
This is a new repository currently containing the implementation of the `CS342 HW1/`.
This contains simple data objects. Requirements are defined as unit tests in `CS342 HW1Tests/`.

Note: I believe source code and test code should be the documentation, unless comments are absolutely needed for context of decisions or assumptions.
